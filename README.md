## Introduction

This is my nanodegree arcade game. It is about creating a game using _html canvas_ and _javascript object oriented programming_ 
It is very easy to use and fun.

### Installation

 It is very easy to use.
 
1. get the source code form [here](https://github.com/pettibetty/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

2. download it, open index.html in your browser and reday to play.

### How this game works

1. Before the game is loaded the use is ask to select between a boy or girl player.

2. If the player gets his/her way to the to water then the he/she scores a point.
3. If the player collises with an enemy then he/she loses one point. 
4. To play use the cursor keys. Cursor Up key to move up, Cursor down to move down, cursor left to move left, cursor right to move right. 

### Bugs
 At the moment I have got the basic features working, if you can across any problem, bug please let me know.
